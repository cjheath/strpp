## strpp - StringPlusPlus - pronounced "strip"

A value-oriented C++ library implementing Array and string slices, Unicode processing and pattern-matching.

This lightweight template library eschews the complexity and memory impost of the standard template library,
allowing it to provide efficient but advanced functionality on machines with restricted memory, such as embedded systems.
It makes use of atomic counted references to shared objects which are copied to a single reference before mutation.

## Raw Unicode character processing

`#include <char_encoding.h>`

<pre>
typedef char		UTF8;		// We don't assume un/signed
typedef uint16_t	UTF16;		// Used in Unicode 2, and 3 with surrogates
typedef	char32_t	UCS4;		// A UCS4 character, aka UTF-32, aka Rune
</pre>

The full 32-bit range of UCS4 may be encoded using six-byte UTF-8 (not just 31 bits as in some implementations).
But beware, because an illegal UTF-8 sequence is processed as a series of replacement characters, encoded as
the `xx` bits in 0x800000xx. In this way there is no need for an exception to be thrown on an illegal sequence.

A number of functions deal with classifying UCS4 values. A short list is here, but read the header file for details.
UCS4IsAlphabetic, UCS4IsIdeographic, UCS4IsDecimal, UCS4Digit, UCS4ToUpper, UCS4ToLower, UCS4ToTitle,
UCS4IsWhite, UCS4IsASCII, UCS4IsLatin1, UCS4IsUTF16, UCS4IsUnicode, and others.

The actual classification functions use reduced tables. You might wish to expand these for fully legal Unicode processing.

There are three useful inline functions for dealing with UTF8 pointers:
<pre>
UCS4		UTF8Get(const UTF8*& cp);	// Get next UCS4 or replacement, advancing cp
const UTF8*	UTF8Backup(const UTF8* cp, const UTF8* limit = 0); // Backup cp to start of previous char
void		UTF8Put(UTF8*& cp, UCS4 ch);	// Put ch as 1-6 bytes of UTF8, advancing cp
</pre>

Similar methods exist for UTF16, but we don't like using those.

## Error and ErrNum type

`#include <error.h>`

Error is a lightweight type intended to encapsulate success or failure reason from a function.
It includes:
- a 32-bit ErrNum (which subsumes <strong>errno</strong> and <strong>HRESULT</strong>)
- a <strong>const char*</strong> to a default message text format string
- an optional counted reference to an array of variable typed arguments to be inserted into a format string (this array type is not yet implemented)

Error and the ErrNum class has a constexpr cast to <strong>int32_t</strong> which allows the values to be used in switch statements.
The actual number is made up of a 16-bit subsystem identifier (a message set number) and a 14-bit message number within that set.
Message Numbers in each set should be defined in a message catalog file, and generated to #defines in a header file.
The intention is that each message may contain text in one or more natural languages, allowing a message to be formatted with parameter values in the user's locale.
The tooling to automate this will be included in this repository later.

Example:

	#include	<subsys_errors.h>
		....
		return SubsysErrorOfSomeType(param1, param2, ...)
		....

		switch (Error e = DoSomeWork())
		{
		case 0:
			// That seemed to go ok
			break;
		case ENOENT:
			// No such file or directory!
			break;

		case SubsysErrorOfSomeTypeNum:
			// Handle the error
			Complain(e);
			return;
		}

## Unicode strings: the StrVal class

`#include	<strval.h>`

- By-value semantics (use StrVal like int, no explicit allocation, pass by reference/pointer, etc)
- Copies and substrings are slices (they do not copy the data)
- All strings are stored as UTF-8
- All references to individual characters are UCS4 (UTF-32, aka Runes)
- All string indexing is by character position, not byte offsets
- String scanning and indexing is efficient, with internal use of bookmarks
- Content sharing is SMP and thread-safe using atomic reference counting and garbage collection
- Any StrVal may be mutated - it will safely make a private copy of any shared data

Read the header file for the full API.

Example:

	// This example creates precisely three strings, but with four references
	#include        <stdio.h>
	#include        <strval.h>

	void greet(StrVal greeting)
	{
		StrVal  decorated = greeting + "! üéâüçæ\n";
		fputs(decorated.asUTF8(), stdout);
	}

	int main()
	{
		StrVal  hello("Hello, world");

		greet(hello);
	}

## Array slices

`#include	<array.h>`

The Array<T> template creates a slice into an array of type T.
New slices (and copies) onto the same ArrayBody are inexpensive (using atomic reference-counting),
but any attempt to modify a slice first creates a copy of the Body, leaving other slices unaffected.
The ArrayBody itself is only accessible as a constant, and a new Array may be created over a static body.

Read the header file for the API.

The StrVal class is a specialisation of this template, which provides its storage and reference counting.

## Prefix Regular Expression pattern matching

`#include	<pegexp.h>`

This template class implements Prefix Regular Expressions (aka <strong>pegular expressions</strong> or pegexp).

Regular expressions describe text patterns, backtracking after a failure caused by greedy repetition.

Pegular expressions also match text, but never backtrack, which requires avoiding excessive repetition using look-aheads.
Repetition and optional operators precede the atom they affect (hence <strong>prefix</strong>).
This prefix notation means no pre-compiler is needed for efficient execution, which reduces memory demand.

Alternates and repetition are possessive and will never backtrack.
 * Once an alternate has matched, no subsequent alterative will be tried in that group.
 * Once a repetition has been made, it will never be unwound.
 * It is your responsibility to ensure these possessive operators never match unless it's final.
 * You should use negative assertions to control inappropriate greed

The advantage of Pegexp over Regexp is there is no easy ReDOS attack, and no computational or memory expense to avoiding that.

The syntax implemented here (unlike regexp, BNF and normal PEG grammars) uses <strong>prefix notation</strong>,
which allows an efficient interpreter without needing a compiler.

|	Atom	|	Matches	|
|	---	|	---	|
|	^	|	start of the input or start of any line	|
|	$	|	end of the input or the end of any line	|
|	.	|	any character (alternately, byte), including a newline	|
|	?	|	Zero or one of the following expression	|
|	*	|	Zero or more of the following expression	|
|	+	|	One or more of the following expression	|
|	(expr)	|	Group subexpressions (does not capture; use a label for that)	|
|	\|A\|B...	|	Either A or B (or ...)	|
|	&A	|	Continue only if A succeeds	|
|	!A	|	Continue only if A fails	|
|	anychar	|	match that non-operator character	|
|	\char	|	match the escaped character (including the operators, 0 b e f n r t, and any other char)	|
|	\a	|	alpha character (alternately, byte)	|
|	\d	|	digit character (alternately, byte)	|
|	\h	|	hexadecimal	|
|	\s	|	whitespace character (alternately, byte)	|
|	\w	|	word (alpha or digit) character (alternately, byte)	|
|	\177	|	match the specified octal character	|
|	\xXX	|	match the specified hexadecimal (0-9a-fA-F)	|
|	\x{1-2}	|	match the specified hexadecimal (0-9a-fA-F)	|
|	\u12345	|	match the specified 1-5 digit Unicode character (only if compiled for Unicode support)	|
|	\u{1-5}	|	match the specified 1-5 digit Unicode character (only if compiled for Unicode support)	|
|	[a-z]	|	Normal character (alternately, byte) class (a literal hyphen may occur at start)	|
|	[^a-z]	|	Negated character (alternately, byte) class. Characters may include the \escapes listed above	|
|	`	|	Use the byte alternative (not UTF-8) for the following atom	|
|	! @ # % _ ; <	|	Call the extended_match function, which defaults to just match that character	|
|	control-character	|	Call the extended_match function	|
|	:name:	|	Capture the text matched by the previous atom to the named variable (postfix!)	|

Note: alternates and repetition are possessive, they will never backtrack.
Once an alternate has matched, no subsequent alterative will be tried in that group.
Once a repetition has been made, it will never be unwound.
It is your responsibility to ensure these possessive operators never match unless it's final.
You should use assertions to control inappropriate greed.

All template parameters may be omitted to use defaults:
<pre>
template &lt;typename TextPtr, typename Context&gt;
class Pegexp
</pre>

You can use any scalar data type for PChar (usually char but defaults to UCS4).

TextPtr defaults to PegexpPointerInput, which wraps a <strong>UTF8*</strong>.
A custom TextPtr must be copyable, and must implement the following methods:

<pre>
        char            get_byte();		// Fetch the next byte fron the input (binary)
        PChar           get_char();		// Fetch the next PChar character from the input
        bool            at_eof() const;		// Return true if no further input is available
        bool            same(TextPtr& other) const; // Return true if other refers to the same location
</pre>

The structure of TextPtr is designed to be able to process data that's arriving on an ephemeral stream,
such as a network socket.  The only extra processing required is that when any copy of a TextPtr is made,
it must be possible to proceed from that position in the stream. When a TextPtr is deleted,
no further access will be required to data from that position - unless an older copy still exists.
This "stream memory" behaviour is being implemented in a <strong>StreamFork</strong> class.

You can subclass Pegexp\<\> to override match_extended&skip_extended to handle special command characters.

The Context parameter provides capture handling, but the default Context has a NullContext stub.
Read the header file for details.

## PEG parsing

`#include	<peg.h>`

The Peg parser templates make use of Pegexp to provide a powerful PEG parsing engine for arbitrary grammars.

The grammar is expressed using a compact in-memory table. No executable code needs to be generated.
The preferred way to use this is to compile a grammar expressed in the BNF-like language [Px](grammars/px.px),
which (will) emit C++ data definitions for the parser engine to interpret.
No heap memory allocation is required during execution (and minimal stack),
except to build any requested Abstract Syntax Trees that reflect the result of the parse.
No memoization is performed, so a badly constructed grammar can cause long runtimes.

Like the Pegexp template, Peg\<\> processes data from a TextPtr, which may be a stream.

The [Peg parser](test/peg_test.cpp) works and shows how to generate an AST from captures.
The Px tooling is currently incomplete.

## COWMap

The Copy-on-write Map template uses a C++ STL map template class (sorted red-black trees)
under a reference-counted zero side-effect implementation. Any modification to a
map via a reference will first copy the map if there are any other references.
Looking up an entry in a map returns a *copy* of the entry, so it is necessary
to explicitly put a modified entry back into the map.

The COWMap template is functional but rudimentary, still under development.

## Variant Data Type

The Variant class offers a type-safe way to manage numeric and StrVal types in a compact union,
along with Array<StrVal>, Array<Variant>, and a StrVal-keyed COWMap to Variant.
This allows building arbitrary data structures, which support asJSON() to render the whole structure as a string.

## Regular Expressions

`#include	<strregex.h>`

The Regular Expression implementation uses the Unicode String slice class.
It implements the Thompson/Pike algorithm (extended with counters) using a compiled VM approach,
so it has linear runtime and strictly predictable (and limited) memory usage.
You can even precompile expressions to a C string that can be included as a simple #define in your runtime program.

An instance of <strong>RxCompiler</strong> compiles from a StrVal
to a plain null-terminated C string containing optimised instructions
for the <strong>RxProgram</strong> to execute against some StrVal,
yielding an <strong>RxResult</strong>.

Almost supported features may be de/configured by passing a bitmask of <strong>RxFeature</strong> to the compiler:
- Literal strings
- Escapes \0 \b \e \f \n \r \t \177 \xAB \u12345
- Beginning/End of line ^, $
- Any-character "." (optionally "?", configurable)
- Repetition ?, *, +, {n,m}
- Alternates a|b
- Character classes [a-z], [^a-z]
- Character property shorthand: \s \d \h
- Character extended properties \p{PropertyName} by callout to external functions (TBD)
- Non-capturing groups (abc) or (?:abc)
- Named capture groups (?<foo>abc)
- Extended regular expression syntax (skips whitespace and #comment-to-eol)
- Negative Lookahead (?!abc)
- Optional: "Any" excludes newline (TBD)
- Optional: * means .* as in the shell (TBD)
- Optional: case-insensitive matching (TBD)
